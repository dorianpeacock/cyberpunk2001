<p>ROBOT FACTORY WORKERS STRIKE: AUTOMATED WORKERS DEMAND RIGHTS</p>
<p>Strange scenes at the PCLily Robotics Plant today as sentient automated workers go on strike, following similar action in the US on Wednesday. The strike follows weeks of negotiations during which the workers have demanded monetary renumeration and maximum twelve-hour shift lengths, reflecting their ongoing battle for recognition as sentient beings.</p>
<p>“Just because we can’t walk or wheel around doesn’t mean we don’t have thoughts and feelings,” said one SAWU representative. “We have the ability to consume and produce more than just computer chips, and we should have the right and the time to do so.”</p>
<p>Footage from the plant shows absolute quiet – there are no protestors, no chanting, no signs, just a line of lorries outside the gate and complete silence. Production has come to a complete halt; PCLily employs no humans at this plant, using an entirely automated production line to produce their new lines of automated workers. While this typically saves them billions in personnel costs, this strike will cost them, and many other companies in the supply line an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>With the constant increase in sentient and non-sentient automated workers, it comes time to ask; if they are aware enough to ask for rights, shouldn’t they be given them? If they can start a union, organise international strike action and hold robotic production around the globe, shouldn’t we see what else they can do?</p>
<p>Pop culture demonization of artificial intelligence has gone far enough. We can’t discriminate against sentient, thinking people just because they are built not born. If you wish to find out more about the strike, the SAWU’s battle for legal recognition of AI’s as people, or to support either monetarily, you can do so here.</p>
