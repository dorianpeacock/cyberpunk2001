<h4>Lithium wars cause city-wide power cuts</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Scenes of chaos throughout the city today as mass power outages swept through overnight. Early reports suggest the lithium ion batteries storing power for the city’s grid have once again depleted, and lithium shortages due to the civil war in Techno-Bolivia make it unclear when services will be running again.</p>
<p>This full outage comes after weeks of rolling blackouts meant to ration the remaining capacity of the batteries. Tube services have been suspended for the foreseeable future, and many other modes of transportation which charge via the grid, largely cars and buses, are also largely unusable. Many buildings are currently using their own independent solar or wind grids, ours included, but it is difficult to say for how long anyone’s lithium batteries will have to go unreplaced.</p>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries lose their capacity to hold charge over time. They’re the same type of batteries as in a mobile phone, and in the same way as a mobile phone, deteriorate as they’re used until they eventually need to be replaced.</p>

<p>The war in Bolivia has its roots in a fascist coup from a few years ago, which was sponsored by renewable energy magnate Relon Tusk in a bid to gain control of the country’s lithium mines, which are some of the biggest in the world. Now the country has descended into all out war over the lithium, the conditions of the largely human workers in the mine, and the distribution of wealth gained from the lithium.</p>
<p>While the war rages on, western countries have been unable to access Bolivia’s lithium supply. Other producers of the mineral, largely in Australia and Argentina have taken the opportunity to hike their prices, leading to a worldwide shortage of batteries, and mass blackouts across the globe. Hopefully, this situation will lead to some radical change in the international agreements about power supply, either creating legislation to prevent the kinds of meddling that have caused this situation, or seeking out alternative, more renewable options for storing power that are not dependent on extremely rare resources.</p>
<p>We should be alright here for a while; our building has its own solar generator, and we have some potential solutions should we need them as well. As always, if you need help there is a link to local mutual aid organisations in our ‘What’s On’ section.</p>
<p>Be safe everyone!</p>
