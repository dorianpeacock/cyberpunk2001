<h4>Heist of the century!! Valuable art piece stolen from the Side</h4>
<p></p>
<p>London art collector Terence Uphill’s Side estate was burgled sometime early this morning, a source reports. The missing piece, Candid Australia, is estimated to be worth over ten million GBP.</p>
<p>In recent years more and more of the ultra-rich have been moving themselves and their collections of objects to the Side, in the hopes that the station’s strict border controls and highly advanced automated security would keep them safe from both money seeking robbers and politically motivated attacks. However, as more and more people have migrated to the Side to support the lifestyles its wealthy residents demand, the strict border restrictions that assured their safety have only become looser and looser.</p>
<p>The suspects involved in this robbery are thought to have entered the station on work visas, though whether or not these were legitimate is yet to be seen. Security footage from Mr Uphill’s passive security system shows two people enter through the staff entrance in business wear, before moving to the gallery room and simply walking out the front door with the statue. When reached for comment, staff at Mr Uphill’s estate stated that they did not question the intruders as they assumed they worked for him in another department.</p>
<p>“Just walk in” burglaries, as they have become known, have become increasingly common in the last few years. Perpetrators dress in inconspicuous clothing, usually a suit or high-vis jacket, then just walk in and take whatever they’re after. Very few suspects in these cases have ever been caught, which has contributed to their popularity.</p>
<p>As always, I refuse to print/post descriptions of suspects in ongoing criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Candid Australia is, in this writer’s opinion, an ugly, faux-political monstrosity. I can’t post an image, as licensing an image of the statue is insanely expensive, which has contributed to the inflation of the piece’s perceived value. Take my word for it, it’s the kind of piece that makes middle class suburban white people go “Wow, that’s so deep”, which is usually a pretty sure indication that it isn’t.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the statue has been stolen, leading to some speculation that the previous thief hid some intriguing secret within the statue. These are just rumours, fed to me by a source of a source, and are unlikely to hold much merit, but it would narrow down the search if this was found to be true. Unfortunately, the previous thief was killed in a prison riot three months ago, so we’ll never know for sure.</p>
<p>Any updates on the case will, of course, be published here.</p>
