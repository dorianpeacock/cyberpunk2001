<h4>Cows! Gosh there just are so many of them these days.</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Have you noticed? It used to be that all the fields in the rural areas around London had horses in them because they were owned by rich people who could have a field or several just sitting there not making money because the more money you have the less you have to make bc capitalism is bullshit. But now they’ve all got cows in.</p>
<p>Some people think they’re trying to get in on the environmentalism, making locally and sustainably farmed meat for people who want to be sustainable but not vegan. Some people think they’re getting that good good McDonald’s money. I think it’s probably both, but what do I know, I’m not even a real Londoner. I’m just some guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve got no beef with cows (badum tish), but they aren’t exactly good for the old environment, if you know what I mean. I’ve never really understood why, I think it has something to do with deforestation for cow farms and possibly them farting too much but either way more cows seems like it’s definitely a bad thing.</p>
<p>But, you know, hey, maybe it isn’t. Maybe more cows here mean less (fewer) cows elsewhere and less/fewer trees being cut down to have places to put them. That’s better isn’t it? I don’t know.</p>
<p>[[This article is brought to you by EAT MY NUTS VEGAN CAFE AND BAKERY. They sell a huge variety of nut-based vegan cakes and pastries, as well as ethically-sourced coffee with locally-sourced nut-based milk alternatives. My favourite of their products is their toffee and walnut brownie, though Pepsi prefers their year-round pumpkin spice latte.

<p>And not to fully out myself as an ex-Bristolian (I was banished after the Starzy Raidboss listening party in June) but I feel like there’s also a much higher cow to field ratio if catch my thinking. Like more fields of cows about and more cows per field. Just a lot More Cows. And if I’m being completely honest, which I do like to be if I can help it, I worry about whether or not they’re a bit cramped. Because, you know, ten years ago, you’d see a field and most of it would be grass with like 15% cow. But there’s more like 40%+ cow so they’ve got less room to move around in. What if it’s causing arguments?</p>
<p>Like it’s hard enough dealing with your housemates as a person, right? And we’ve got logic and empathy and intelligence and all that stuff but cows? No thoughts! Head empty! Just big old pretty eyes! Do you think they know how to amicably solve a conflict? What if one cow keeps stealing food from the other cows? The other cows can’t evict her! They can’t do anything, they’d have to have a fight! But then that might mess up the whole herd’s social order because everyone (everycow) would have to pick sides. And then you’d end up with cow gangs and cow gang wars that can’t be resolved because they’re too stupid to learn conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Anyway. I guess what I’m saying is that cows should have the right to a certain amount of space, and if they do it should be more than what it is. Also that we should be more grateful that we have “higher” brain functions. OR we should all wish we were cows with enough space to roam. I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I was going to say see you tomorrow but I’m not sure if this “publication” is actually daily or if that’s just a name. Don’t get me wrong it is a good name, and if it isn’t daily then it’s an actually fucking hilarious name, but I don’t know if it is a joke or not. See you whenever, I guess. Remember to appreciate cows. Love you.</p>
