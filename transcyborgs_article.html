<h4>Are all cyborgs trans? Scientists say "Kinda, yeah."</h4>
<p></p>
<p>I will admit that was a clickbait title. But is it so far from the truth? You feel disconnected from your body because of how it functions, I feel disconnected from my body because of the way it looks, we’re both getting expensive, difficult to access surgeries to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn’t matter what you or I think because medically speaking, it’s the other way around. All trans people are cyborgs. Any “elective” surgeries or procedures that don’t fall into the realm of traditional plastic surgery have to be done by a techno-biologist, rather than a normal medical professional. That’s HRT, voice training, top and bottom surgeries, going through the same system as you do for your laser eyes and robo limbs.</p>
<p>“B-but,” you may feel the need to say, “those aren’t enhancements! They’re just changes! They should be covered by the normal medical system!” You would be correct, though I would question the authenticity of support of trans people built on cyborg purity. You’ve got the spirit though, and I respect that. If that’s what it takes to get you on side, fine.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing; because gender affirming care is considered by the medical world to be an enhancement, an optional series of procedures, we can’t get it free on the NHS. We have to pay for it. And let’s face facts here, unless you know someone who knows someone, cyborg maintenance is a rich person’s game. People are dying because cyborg maintenance is a rich man’s hobby, a rich man’s playground, a rich man’s science lab.</p>
<p>What can you do about it? For one, reach out to your care providers, make them aware of the situation, and encourage them to lower or remove the financial barrier to entry for gender affirming procedures. For two, write to your MPs asking them to support the acknowledgement of gender affirming care as a necessary medical treatment. Finally, channel your hobbyist, gatekeeping energy into this. We don’t belong in your community. We don’t want to be in it. Just remember we need somewhere to go before you kick us out.</p>
