<h4>Starzy Raidboss concert leads to mass party slash riot</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The streets of London ran in rivers of booze last night following Starzy Raidboss’ final concert of her international tour. I am reporting to you live from a stranger’s darkened living room, where I am nursing the hangover of the century. Apologies if this article is not up to the usual standard as a result.</p>
<p>In my still slightly drunk haze, I struggle to remember many particulars about the concert itself, other than that it was the single greatest experience of my young life. The venue was done up in the Starzy Raidboss signature neon pink and green, which I recently discovered have the hex codes b00b69 and 69b00b. Iconic. I presume the merch stand was good, as I woke up this morning (afternoon) wearing not only a Starzy Raidboss tank top, but Skegness Beetlemen leggings as well. They look like they’re made of blue beetle wings.</p>
<p>I remember a lot of strobe lighting, in the thematic colour palette, at a big projector screen with hypnotic images; swirling vortexes, pools of ink, galaxies in motion, etc. I can still see them when I close my eyes. The music, of course, was phenomenal. I’m sure you’ve heard the single, Interpol’s Most Wanted, by now, though I would argue there are much more clubbable songs on the album. But this isn’t a music review website, so I’ll leave that to the professionals.</p>
<p>The aftermath is where the story is. Imagine, if you will, ten thousand drunk twenty-somethings, high on adrenaline and also drugs, pouring out into the streets of London with no plans for the night. We flooded the clubs, the bars, the pubs. When the booze ran out we moved onto the next place and the next and it was like gay football hooligans. We danced and sang and threw glitter into the river. I made out with several strangers and went home with several more. No matter how bad this hangover gets it will be worth the night I had.</p>
<p>When I woke up forty minutes ago, I asked the person whose flat this is if I could borrow their computer. “What do you need that for?” they asked. I had to explain that I run a moderately popular online news publication for the London area and they said, “Are you the bloke who wrote the thing about the cows?” Someone put on the song.</p>
<p>Of course, amid all of the chaos, some people did choose to take advantage. Many thefts have been reported, largely of booze, but a number of shops are reporting thefts of CD players and other sound systems, fireworks, and rave clothing. I recall, vaguely, a bonfire in a park, fireworks like New Year’s over the Thames, and possibly getting kettled in Camden. I was definitely in Camden, at one point.</p>
<p>Reports this morning on the television news show widespread destruction across the city. Glitter bombing and graffiti mostly, definitely not as bad as the business in Bristol. No broken traffic lights at least. I think it would have been a lot worse if the drag queens hadn’t been keeping an eye on us.</p>
<p>I, by some miracle, did actually see Starzy herself! Not long after the concert ended, I was in a club not too far away, continuing to jam to her music and all of a sudden, there she was; two-tone pink and green hair, six foot two in platform heels, four enormous arms right in front of me.</p>
<p>“Hi Phil,” she said.</p>
<p>I didn’t know how to reply. I was mostly confused; how did she know my name?</p>
<p>“You were at the listening party,” she explained. “You climbed up a traffic light and I had to break it to get you down.” (For legal reasons, I do not recall that happening.)</p>
<p>“I have a website…” I stuttered, I think.</p>
<p>“Yes! I remember you telling me. I hope you’ll say something nice about the concert.”</p>
<p>“I’ll say it was the best night of my life, and it’ll be true.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it will.” She winked at me, then disappeared into the crowd.</p>
<p>It was the best night of my life, and that is true.</p>
<p>Apparently I’m hogging the computer. If there are any updates, I will make sure to post them here, but probably not for a day or so, as I think I might be busy.</p>
<p>Phil</p>
